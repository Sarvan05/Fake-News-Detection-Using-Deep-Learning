# Fake News Detection Using Deep Learning

This project implements a **Fake News Detection system** using Deep Learning (BiLSTM + GloVe embeddings). The model classifies news articles as **FAKE** or **REAL** based on their textual content. It uses the Fake and Real News Dataset and applies text preprocessing, word embeddings, and LSTM-based neural networks to achieve high accuracy.

## üöÄ Features
- Preprocessing of text data (cleaning, tokenization, padding)  
- Word embeddings using **GloVe** (Global Vectors for Word Representation)  
- **Bidirectional LSTM** model for sequence learning  
- Achieves ~87% accuracy on test data  
- Can predict labels for new/unseen news articles  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras**  
- **NumPy**, **Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (for visualization)  
- **Scikit-learn**  

---

## üìä Model Performance
- **Test Accuracy:** ~86.6%  
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score:** ~0.87 (balanced for both FAKE & REAL classes)
