# Fake-News-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project implements a Fake News Detection system using Deep Learning (BiLSTM + GloVe embeddings). The model classifies news articles as FAKE or REAL based on their textual content.  It uses the Fake and Real News Dataset and applies text preprocessing, word embeddings, and LSTM-based neural networks to achieve high accuracy.
