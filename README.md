# Fake-News-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project implements a Fake News Detection system using Deep Learning (BiLSTM + GloVe embeddings). The model classifies news articles as FAKE or REAL based on their textual content.  It uses the Fake and Real News Dataset and applies text preprocessing, word embeddings, and LSTM-based neural networks to achieve high accuracy.

🚀 Features

Preprocessing of text data (cleaning, tokenization, padding).

Word embeddings using GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation).

Bidirectional LSTM model for sequence learning.

Achieves ~87% accuracy on test data.

Can predict labels for new/unseen news articles.
